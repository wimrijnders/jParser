jParser
-------

This project contains a light-weight recursive-descent parser written in java. Its initial goal was to make data extraction and handling a whole lot simpler.

Grammars are defined using an EBNF dialect. Parsed input is converted into an internal tree-structure, which can be traversed and manipulated further to create a desired output. 

In due time, I will slap a license on this.

Feel free to contact me about this project through GitHub.

Kind Regards,

Wim Rijnders.

### Personal Notes

This has been a hobby project since time immemorial, and has been ported over various programming languages before becoming this incarnation in java. In fact, the evolution has not stopped, this parser has spawned a ruby descendant.

After having used the parser in several paid projects, it dawned on me that perhaps this little piece of code may be of use to others, never mind that there are plenty of other parsers out there. So, I decided to put it on GitHub.
